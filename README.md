Calculate technical indicators and store the result. You can decide which indicator on crypto currency will be calculated by an UI.

## Development
For Development all required systems are in the docker-compose.yml and can be started with `docker-compose up`.

## Mock
The data for the mock-service are from cryptocpmare.com (https://www.cryptocompare.com/api/#-api-data-histominute-). 
So we should use this data also for the unit tests.
